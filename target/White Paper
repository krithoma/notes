Text adventure in the style of Adventure of Atari 2600.

The object of the game is to enter the catacombs and retrieve the golden chalice.

The catacombs consist of the entrance room connected to a three by three square of gameplay spaces.
The gameplay map data will be stored in an SQL table and loaded into a hash map at game start.
Another table containing the game object list will also be read into memory.

The player will be asked to provide a character name.
The name will be used to create a stat data set in a player info table.
The stats include number of moves until game completion and win/loss ratio.
This data will be persistent across game sessions. ie. High scores.

The in game objects are: sword, key, chalice.
The in game entities are: Player, Ogre.

The ogre will attack the player on sight and will end the game with a loss unless
    the player has the sword which allows temporary safe movement through the room.
The player will be given a clue when the ogre is in an adjacent room.
The ogre can move to an adjacent room once per round or can stay in place.

The player can only carry one item at a time.

Game play ends if the player is caught by the ogre or the chalice is taken to the starting room.
Items and ogre are randomized, only one item to a room, but items can share space with the ogre.
The chalice room is locked and requires key to open.
