Project 0:
Due Feb 23rd
Requirements:

Java/Maven project

Employs some amount of persistence through an Azure SQL database hosted remotely by Azure
Employs unit testing with high code coverage
Employs logging
You may not use Java's data structures like Java's built in ArrayList
You must at some point use your own data structures
It must be a command line application
    (ie you insert commands into command line as the program is running using a scanner
    and the program will output information to the console output)
It must be user-friendly and understandable in a short 5-minute demo

Topic:
Anything you like, but must "do something"
(ie, not talking about abstract cookies)
    Examples:
       Retail application
            How can this be done?
            We could perhaps store information about products or customers on the database
            And have a customer purchase things using the command line
       Text adventure game
            How can this be done?
            We could perhaps store paths that the user can go down in the database
            And have them printed as needed
            While storing player history
       Or,
       Anything you like! So long as it fits other requirements

       I believe that learning should a guided exploratory process
